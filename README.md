The [master]([https://github.com/ShalokShalom/EBiCS_Firmware/wiki](https://github.com/EBiCS/EBiCS_Firmware/tree/master) branch supports sensored motors, Bafang-, Kunteng- Kingmeter-Displays, and debugging.

User-specific settings can be done in a user-friendly GUI.

Throttle, torque-simulation, and torque-sensor modes are available.

The [sensorless_VESC](https://github.com/EBiCS/EBiCS_Firmware/tree/Sensorless_VESC) branch has adapted the VESC's sensorless control. It was recently optimized for a Fischer ETH 1606 bike. 
Of course, it will work with other motors, too.

A short tutorial can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/EBiCS/EBiCS_Firmware/wiki).
