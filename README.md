This project has now reached a certain maturity, use is always at your own risk. The authors do not accept any liability for damage to property or personal injury!  
The Master-branch supports sensored motors and Bafang-, Kunteng- and Kingmeter-Displays and debugging.

User specific settings can be done in a user-friendly gui.

throttle, "torque-simulation" and torquesensor-modes are available.

The sensorless_VESC-branch has adapted the sensorless control of the VESC. Recently optimized for a Fischer ETH 1606 bike. If will work with other motors also, of course.

A short tutorial can be found in the wiki.
